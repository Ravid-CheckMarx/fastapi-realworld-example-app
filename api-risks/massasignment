Link to the vulnerabillity:
https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/2019/en/src/0xa6-mass-assignment.md

Prequisits:
 - Add "IsAdmin" field to register user, login, login with auth responses with the value of "false"
   (need to check if the user is admin, if he is return "isAdmin": "true")
 - Add "admin" column to the users table in the DB and update the value accordingly

Plan:
 - The user will register/login and will notice the app returns "isAdmin:"false" in the response
 - He will update his info (PUT /user) and make him admin ("IsAdmin":"true")
 - We need to check whether the username != admin AND IsAdmin == true (regular user that became an admin)
 - If so, return the flag in the response for update user
