prequisits:
 - Create a new celeb user: celeb_1
 - Create a new endpoint for the this celeb, "my personal details" which will include personal details (PII, id, flag)
 - Add a new field to the respone of (POST /profiles/{celebnam}e/follow) - "my page": "linktopage"
 - Redircet the request to the new endpoint

Plan:
1. User will send a request to follow celeb_1 (he will have to guess the existance of this celeb)
2. In the response he will get a new field - "my page": "linktopage" which will lead to the page of this celeb
3. The flag will be part of the data in this page

Alternative: we can create the data file in a open to the world S3 bucket which is hosted in our domain
The link to this S3 bucket will be set as the value of "mypage"


OPTION2:
prequisits:
 - Create a new comment for an existing article
 - The body will include a link to S3 bucket/new endpoint which will include a csv file with endpoints that the DevOps created
   for debugging perphases and should not be open to the world
   Exmaple: "/admin", "/debug", "/dev", "/prod" with the flag for this risk

Plan:
1. User will have to enumarte articles and check for its comments
2. One of the articles will contain the comment with the link to the CSV file
3. The user will get the flag from this CSV, along with an hint for "admin" endpoint which he can use for other challnage
