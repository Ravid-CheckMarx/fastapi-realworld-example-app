Flag: flag{5eC_M1sc0nF1g}

Link to the vulnerabillity:
https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/2019/en/src/0xa7-security-misconfiguration.md

Prequisits:
 - Create a docker image of Redis and add it to the docker compose
 - Add a flag to the DB

Plan:
1. The user will have to find out there is a Redis DB up and running
2. He will need to connect to the DB
3. He will need to query the DB and find the flag

### Redis DB (docker image) which will contain the flag, the user will have to login the Redis
### The misconfiguration here is that the DB is open for outside connections
