Link to the vulnerabillity:
https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/2019/en/src/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization.md

Prequisits:
 - Add "id" field for each user, this should be returned in every user details responses like:
   User register response
   User login response
 - The "id" should be also added to the db in every table the user info is presented and be retivred in every response
 - The "id" should be also added to the API spec file 

1. Create user A -> register endpoint (POST /users)  
2. Create user B -> register endpoint (POST /users) 
3. Create article with user B -> (POST /articles)
3. Login to user A -> login with remember token endpoint (POST /users/login)

Plan:
OPTION 1:
Update user B (id of user B) email -> update user endpoint (PUT /user) - We will need to change the code so it will not verify the user trying to make the update
(in case you are authnticated you should be able to update any user details)
get the flag:
if the id of the authnticated user != the id he is trying to change -> get flag
OPTION 2:
Update other user article ->  update article endpoint (PUT /articles/{article_slug}) [right now - "you are not an author of this article"] -

OPTION 4: 
Delete other user comment ->  delete comment endpoint (DEL /articles/{article_slug}/comments/{comment_id}) [right now - "you are not an author of this article"]
