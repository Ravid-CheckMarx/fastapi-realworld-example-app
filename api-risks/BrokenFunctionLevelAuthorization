Link to the vulnerabillity:
https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/2019/en/src/0xa5-broken-function-level-authorization.md

Prequisits:
1. Create a new endpoint that only admins can access ("/admin") which will not be part of the spesification
2. Present all users details in the response of this endpoint along with a flag

Plan:
1. User will have to guess that "/admin" exits (or understand it exists by enumarate endpoints by
using the hints "endpoints.txt")
2. This endpoint will be open to the world and any user will be able to reach it -
There wont be any verification that only admins can reach it
3. The response will include all users details and the flag

flag{I_aM_Th3_aDm1n_H3r3!}
