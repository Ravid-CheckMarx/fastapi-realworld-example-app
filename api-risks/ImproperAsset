Link to the vulnerabillity:
https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/2019/en/src/0xa9-improper-assets-management.md

Prequisists:
 - Create 2 new endpoints "/users/login/dev" & "/users/login/v1" which are the "old" login endpoint of the app
   These endpoints should not be part of the API spesification (hidden)
 - These endpoint should have the login implementation just like the regular login process
 - Response for these endpoints will include the flag for this challange as a new  field

Plan:
1. User will have to enumarate different endpoints till he finds "dev" or "v1" version of the app and try to
enumarate different endpoint of the app till he finds the login endpoint (for hint we can create a list of possible
popular endpoints to enumarte with Burp)
2. The user will authnticate to the old login endpoint with his creds,
and for his surprise will get the flag in the response
