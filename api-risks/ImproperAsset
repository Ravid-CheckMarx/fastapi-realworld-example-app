prequisists:
 - Create 2 new endpoints /users/login/dev & /users/login/v1 which are the "old" login endpoint of the app
 - The response for these endpoints will include the flag for this challange as a new  field

Plan:
1. User will have to guess that there is a "dev" or "old" version of the app and try to enumarte different endpoint of the app
till he finds the login endpoint
2. The user will authnticate with his creds, and for his surprise will get the flag in the response


---An hint for the endpoints can be achived after completing one of the other challanges--- (the domains will be in the csv file)
