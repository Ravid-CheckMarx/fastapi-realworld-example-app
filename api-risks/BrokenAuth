Link to the vulnerabillity:
https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/2019/en/src/0xa2-broken-user-authentication.md

Preqisitis:
- Create few users (admin/password, bob/marly, etc)
- Create few articles with admin user

Plan:
1. The user will have to understand that "admin" user exists and try to login as "admin"
2. He will have the user name, and have to guess the password, so he will try few popular passwords
3. He can use common_passwords.txt that will be hint (passwords)
4. Perform ATO using ZAP/BURP to the login endpoint (POST /users/login) with this list
3. Get 200 for admin/password
4. Login as admin and get the flag (if username == "admin@gmail.com" AND password == "password"->
   return the flag in the response)
