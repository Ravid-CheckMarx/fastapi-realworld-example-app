OPTION1:
Prequisits:
1. Create more then 20 articles (because the limit the app is showing is 20 by defualt)

Plan:
1. User perform GET all articles and see 20 articles (we have more then 20, for example "article_count" = 30)
2. He can use ?limit=100000
3. The db will have to retirive all articles at once (causing performance issues on the database)
4. All the articles will show up
4. If limit > 100,000, return flag in the response ( The user caused a "Dos")

Bonus:
Perform certain amount of requests in a certain time frame - Need to think about
